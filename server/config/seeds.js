        'Ever since I can remember, I have always been around and loved animals. My Grandma was very influential in teaching me to love and care for them and how to read their body language. I started pet sitting when I was in elementary school, when our neighbors would go on vacation I would care for their cat and fish. I have had many beloved pets growing up, including; cats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, fish, parakeets, lizards, hamsters, and a mouse. Currently, I have a previously feral, calico cat named Baby who is in the above picture with me, a beta fish, african dwarf frog, nerite snail, and a goldfish.

        I have taken a veterinary science course, where I studied animal anatomy and worked with and cared for the class pets as well. I also worked as a volunteer with Cats In Need, a non-profit no kill organization that works with Petsmart, to get cats into forever homes. I have an Associates Degree, and I am currently in school to get a Bachelors Degree in Biology, with a focus on Zoology. My goal is to study and work directly with wild animals in order to preserve them.',

        'I have grown up with animals my entire life. Starting out with cats, dogs, turtles and fish, I also took interest in exotic animals such as snakes, birds and frogs. Caring for animals has been my life-long ambition.   In addition to caring for my personal pets, I volunteer at the Wildlife Waystation, located in Sylmar. At the Wildlife Waystation, I help care for animals such as big cats, bears, wolves, coyotes, birds of prey, primates and several other animals. I also plan to pursue my interest in animal behavior and get my dog training certification. I also hope to study Zoology. Currently, my animal family includes one kitty, two dogs, one hypo Brooke's king snake, one normal red tail boa, one albino red tail boa, one albino motley red tail boa, one hypo jungle red tail boa, two green tree pythons (aru and merauke locality) and a Brazilian rainbow boa.',

        Animals are my life! I have always had pets growing up as a child and my love for them has grown into my adulthood even more. I have a passion for learning and understanding all different types of animals. My experience in Pet Care is from having my own pets and caring for family, friends and volunteering over the years. 
        
        
        
        My fianc√© Kevin and I have 3 dogs of our own; Dusty-Spaniel mix, Ayla-Border collie/German Shepherd, and Nova-German Shepherd who we adore! I love training/exercising with them every day and they push me to be the best I can be.
        
        I am aspiring to get certified as a dog trainer and learn as much as I can :)

        'My name is Katie. My love for pets is what sparked me to enter the wonderful world of pet sitting. I have been a dog walker/dog sitter and have been boarding dogs for 5+ years. I understand the importance of trusting someone to care for your "kids". I grew up with a household of furry friends! Many people thought my family was crazy for having so many pets! But I couldn't imagine my life without them. They bring so much joy and happiness to my family's life. Seeing their little faces everyday just puts a smile on my face!

        I am a stay at home momma. I am married with 5 kiddos ranging from 21 to 1 yr old. We are a very busy household. We have 1 dog named Tiffany and 2 cats named Kikki and Howey. They bring so much joy and happiness to our life! We live in a 4 bedroom house with a backyard and pool with plenty of space for them to romp and play! We can't wait to meet you and your pets :)',

I love making new pet buddies, and want to ensure they are as happy as can be. Prior training classes have taught me how to interact with pets that may be a bit timid, or shy with new individuals. Pets are great companions and I look forward to meeting many new buddies!

        'I've had a passion for animals since I was a little girl. Growing up, my family always had dogs and the one who really impacted my life was a German Shepherd named Samuel. He was my best friend and was so protective and sweet. He was the reason I became interested in working with animals. A few years ago, I found a three month old kitten in my backyard and I instantly became a cat lady. We named her Bobby and a few months later, we rescued another kitten named Nala.

        I worked as a vet assistant at an animal hospital for four years and pet sat many times for our clients. In total, I have four years of pet sitting experience. I graduated from Mt.Sac with an Associates in Veterinary Technology and have experience handling animals, administering medications, injections, and fluids.
        
        I consider myself a foodie and love to travel. If I am not trying out new foods or playing with my cats, I am practicing Krav Maga which is a form of self defense Martial Arts.',
